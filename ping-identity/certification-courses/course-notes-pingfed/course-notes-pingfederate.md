### PingFederate Overview:

* Single Sign-On  using SAML/OAUTH/OpenID/SCIM.
* Authentication Authority  Auth polities /w MFA and directory services intergration.
* Workspace, Customer, and Partner Identities provides registration/profile management/password reset services.. while connecting to social media authenications methods.

### PingFederate Features/Server Roles:

* Identity Provider \(IdP\) Regarding Browser SSO, PingFed can authenticate users \(using login or directory services\) and using industry standard protocols such as SAML/WS-Federation/WS-Trust, PingFed can build _outbound assertions_ for supported applications. 
* Service Provider \(SP\) PingFed supports accepting _inbound assertions_ and passing the _user attributes_ from these assertions. Example: Using Social media profiles \(Twitter\) using the supported OpenID connectors. 
* Account Provisioning PingFed supports SCIM to create/manage user accounts. As an IdP, PingFed can create user accounts on outbound SPs. 
* OAuth 2.0 Protocol PingFed supports acting as a Oauth Authorization Server. "Allows a research owner, to grant auth to a client requesting access to a resource protected by a resource server"....  Example: SaaS provider wants access to social media account resources. 
* OpenID Connect \(Identity Layer built on OAuth 2.0\) Provides access to user information. "Who is making the request?" 
* Relying Party PingFed can act as a proxy? to complete the OAuth login on an OpenID Connect provider and pass the attributes onto a supported application.

### PingFed Deployment

Deployment as Stand Alone server \(direct to the internet/DMZ\) or via a reverse proxy server.

PingFed can be installed as Cluster - Multiple "Runtime Engine" with one Adminstrative Console.

Starting with PingFed 9.0, Adaptive Clusters support "dynamic discovery of cluster nodes". User state is stored in redundant replica sets.   
Cluster dynamic discover supports AWS EC2/S3/OpenStack Swift. allows for nodes to join/leave public and private cloud services. 

### PingFed Ecosystem

PingID as MFA provider  
PingOne - Multi tentent, Identity as a service solution.  
PingAccess - Identity enabled access management product. protects webapps/APIs by applying security policies to client requests. Using OAuth, PingFed can act as a authorisation source/Token provider for PingAccess.

### Pre-Installation Tasks

* Install a supported version of java
* Set JAVA\_HOME and PATH environment vars at system level
* Request a license key

For _Windows_, use the MSI.  
For _RHEL_, use bash install script to automatically download/install as a daemon using systemd.  
For _all other Linux OSes_, there is a full distro zip. Configuration/daemon setup must be done manually.

### Notes: PingFed Start up files

* run.sh and run.bat in the &lt;install path/bin&gt; folder \(to m $$a = b$$ anually start the server in a console\)
* run.properties \(contains settings that are only applied at startup\)

### Installation Tasks on Windows Server

* Run PingFed Installation MSI
* Select Operational Mode
  * Standalone \(For a single node that will operate independently\)
  * Clustered Admin Node \(Only one node in a cluster can be the admin node\)
  * Clustered  Runtime Node
* Pick the PingFed Admin Console HTTPS/API TCP Port \(Default is 9999\)
* Pick the PingFed Runtime Engine HTTPS TCP Port \(Default is 9031\)
  * Supports a secondary HTTPS Port for additional security measures \(used with WS-Federation or SAML artifact binding types\)
* Pick the PingFed install path
* Complete the MSI Installation stage \(should be running now as a windows service\)
* The PingFed Admin Portal should be avaiable now - https://localhost:9999/pingfederate/app

### Installation Tasks on RHEL

* Disable SELinux \(ONLY DURING INSTALLATION?\)
